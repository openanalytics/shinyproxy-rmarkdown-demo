# 1. Dataset

Waiting time between eruptions and the duration of the eruption for the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA.

It's a data frame with 272 observations on 2 variables:

*	_eruptions_:	numeric	Eruption time in mins
*	_waiting_:	numeric	Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)


# 2. Analysis

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sliderInput("bins", "Number of bins:", min = 1, max = 50, value = 30)
plotOutput("distPlot")
```

```{r, context="server"}
output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
  x <- faithful[, 2]  # Old Faithful Geyser data
  bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
  hist(x, breaks = bins, main = "Histogram of waiting time", xlab = "Waiting time", col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
})
```
